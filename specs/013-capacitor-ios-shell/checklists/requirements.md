# Specification Quality Checklist: Capacitor iOS Shell for Totoro Web

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-04-13
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- The feature description references specific tools (Capacitor, Xcode, Railway) because they are load-bearing constraints from the product owner, not implementation details chosen by the spec. They are treated as named external dependencies, not as a chosen tech stack. Railway is named because "do not add Railway services" is a binding constraint that must survive into the spec. Xcode is named because the handoff boundary is defined by it. "Capacitor" appears only in the feature title and branch name per the user's explicit instruction; the body of the spec describes the outcome (a native iOS shell) without prescribing Capacitor internals, plugin choices, or configuration format.
- FR-002 and FR-003 exclude Next.js server routes by describing the behavior (no server routes in `apps/web`, all HTTP traffic direct to backend) rather than naming the framework feature, keeping the requirement testable without prescribing implementation.
- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
