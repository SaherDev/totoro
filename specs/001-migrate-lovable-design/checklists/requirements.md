# Specification Quality Checklist: Migrate Lovable Design Output

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-03-12
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain — all 3 resolved
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Clarifications Resolved

| # | Topic | Decision |
|---|-------|----------|
| Q1 | SplashScreen placement | Standalone client component at `apps/web/src/components/splash-screen.tsx`, controlled by root layout |
| Q2 | i18n file destination | Move `messages/` to `apps/web/messages/`, update next-intl config, merge Lovable content there |
| Q3 | Component library location | Generic UI primitives → `libs/ui/src/components/` (`@totoro/ui`); Totoro-specific → `apps/web/src/components/` |

## Notes

- All items pass. Spec is ready for `/speckit.plan`.
