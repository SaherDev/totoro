/**
 * Session-only browser geolocation store.
 *
 * Holds the user's coordinates captured once per session via
 * `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition`. The store is in-memory only —
 * no persistence layer, no localStorage, no cookies. It resets every
 * page reload, which is intentional: each new session re-prompts the
 * provider (the browser itself caches and suppresses the dialog based
 * on its own policy — we do not).
 *
 * `location` is `null` when:
 *   - the hook has not yet resolved,
 *   - the user denied the permission prompt,
 *   - `navigator.geolocation` is unavailable (e.g. SSR, non-https),
 *   - the underlying call threw or timed out.
 *
 * `resolved` flips to `true` after the first attempt completes,
 * regardless of outcome. HTTP callers read `location` directly and
 * should always tolerate `null`.
